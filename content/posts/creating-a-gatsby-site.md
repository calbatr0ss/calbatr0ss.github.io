Professionally, I build Single Page Applications in React. This is pretty useful for building JavaScript-heavy, powerful analytics tools for internal business users. So, when I felt it was time to build a personal website and own my own corner of the web, creating a SPA seemed like the logical move. It was what I knew best!

I imagine this was to the horror of my users. My userbase at work are using snappy machines on high speed internal networks, but my personal site users could be using anything from fiber connection to 3G on a budget smartphone. I needed something faster and more suited to the website's needs, because _building an SPA for a static blog site is overkill_.
