## When all you have is a hammer...

Professionally, I build Single Page Applications in React. This is pretty useful for building JavaScript-heavy, powerful analytics tools for internal users on high-speed networks and snappy new machines. So, when I felt it was time to build a personal website and own my own corner of the web, creating a SPA seemed like the logical move. It was what I knew best!

## ...every problem looks like a nail.

I imagine this was to the horror of my users. Users of my professional SPAs are cruising along on snappy machines on high speed networks, but my personal site users could be using anything from fiber connection to 3G on a budget smartphone. I needed something faster and more suited to the website's needs, because _building an SPA for a static blog site is overkill_.

## Enter Gatsby, stage left

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a fantastic framework for building content-heavy sites that are fast by design since your HTML is statically served instead of being generated by JavaScript at runtime. Gatsby has plenty of plugins and you can make your website as simple or as complicated as you want to, so when you build from the ground up you really get an understanding of what is required to make your site the standout website it should be.

Using Gatsby for my new personal site, I was easily able to cook up strategies for content hosting, dynamic page creation, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization), a crucial feature that had eluded me in my SPA past. I also saw serious speed enhancements
